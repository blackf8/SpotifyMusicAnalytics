# SpotifyMusicAnalysis
Attempting to learn the basics of web scraping through Selenium by creating a web scraper that records the users currently playing songs and stores the data within a DB. 
This project has been containerized and automated using Docker + Airflow. 
For future work I aim to conduct some data analysis on the results to learn more about my music habits.
