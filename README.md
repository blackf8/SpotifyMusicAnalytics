# SpotifyMusicAnalysis
Attempting to learn the basics of Selenium and BeautifulSoup by creating a web scraper that records the users currently playing songs and stores the data within a DB. 
My goal is to dockerize and automate the dataflow using Docker + Airflow. 
Finally, I will conduct some data analysis on the results.
